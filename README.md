# Interactive 'process-centric' Gaussian Process Tutorial 
## Process-centric GPs

This tutorial provides an interactive exploration of 'process-centric' Gaussian Processes (GPs) which provide a new framework towards Gaussian processes which is conceptually simpler and easy to implement. Please refer to my thesis for more information: 
![Process-centric Gaussian processes](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/files/2023-2024/balve_process_2024_1kb.pdf)

The notebook can be directly accessed using Google Colab. Best interactivity is achieved when selecting the T4 GPU.

## Running the Tutorial Locally

If you prefer to run the tutorial on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Tutorial:**
   - Clone the repository using Git:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/annkristinbalve/Process-centric-gp_tutorial.git
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/annkristinbalve/Process-centric-gp_tutorial) and extract it to your desired location.

2. **Set Up the Environment:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
   - Navigate to the directory where you cloned/downloaded the repository:
     ```bash
     cd Process-centric-gp_tutorial
     ```
   - Install the required dependencies from the [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/annkristinbalve/Process-centric-gp_tutorial/blob/main/requirements.txt) file:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Start Jupyter Notebook by running:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - In your browser, navigate to the `Tutorial_Colab_Final.ipynb` file and open it to begin the tutorial.
